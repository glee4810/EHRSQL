* **Version**
Version 2.015

* **Description**
Lato is a sanserif typeface family designed in the Summer 2010 by Warsaw-based
designer ﾅ「kasz Dziedzic ("Lato" means "Summer" in Polish). In December 2010
the Lato family was published under the open-source Open Font License by
his foundry tyPoland, with support from Google.

In 2013 - 2014, the family was greatly extended to cover 3000+ glyphs per style.
The Lato 2.010 family now supports 100+ Latin-based languages, 50+
Cyrillic-based languages as well as Greek and IPA phonetics.
In the process, the metrics and kerning of the family have been revised and four
 additional weights were created.
Lato 2.015 Implements mark positioning, which should work for most glyphs
